## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- Use trunk-based development with short-lived feature branches
- Branch naming convention: `(feature|bugfix|hotfix|release)/*`
- Example: `feature/add-payment-integration`

### Commit Messages
Follow the conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

- type: feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore
- scope: auth|payment|listing|etc.
- description: present tense, lowercase
```

### Pull Request Process
1. Maximum PR size: 50 files
2. Required sections (use template from `.github/pull_request_template.md`):
   - Description
   - Type of change
   - Testing performed
   - Security considerations
   - Breaking changes
3. Required approvals:
   - Technical review
   - Security review (for security-related changes)
   - Architecture review (for significant changes)

### Feature Flag Requirements
- All major features must be behind feature flags
- Flag naming: `enable_<feature_name>`
- Include cleanup plan in PR
- Document flag configurations

## Code Standards

### Language-Specific Standards

#### TypeScript (Web)
- Strict mode enabled
- Explicit return types
- Interface over type where possible
- Functional components with hooks
- Props interface definitions

#### Swift (iOS)
- Swift 5.9+
- SwiftLint rules enforced
- Protocol-oriented design
- Combine for reactive programming
- SwiftUI where applicable

#### Kotlin (Android)
- Kotlin 1.9+
- Coroutines for async operations
- Jetpack Compose for UI
- Clean architecture
- Dependency injection with Hilt

### API Standards
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification required
- RESTful principles
- Versioning in URL path
- Comprehensive error responses
- Rate limiting headers

### Security Standards
- Input validation on all user inputs

- Parameterized queries
- Secure headers implementation
- TLS 1.3 required

### Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- Semantic HTML
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader testing

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing
- Minimum coverage: 80%
- Test naming: `should_expectedBehavior_when_condition`
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

### Integration Testing
- API contract testing
- Database integration tests
- Third-party service integration tests
- Error handling verification

### E2E Testing
- Critical user flows
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile responsiveness
- Feature flag testing
- Payment flow testing

### Performance Testing
- Response time < 500ms
- Load testing with expected traffic
- Memory leak detection
- Bundle size monitoring
- API performance benchmarks

## Security Guidelines

### Authentication Implementation
- JWT with short expiry
- Refresh token rotation
- MFA implementation
- Session management
- Biometric authentication support

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Resource-level permissions
- JWT claims validation
- Scope-based access

### Data Protection
- At rest encryption (AES-256)
- In transit encryption (TLS 1.3)
- PII data handling
- Data retention policies
- Secure key management

### Security Review Process
1. Automated security scanning
2. Dependency vulnerability check
3. Manual security review
4. Penetration testing
5. Compliance verification
